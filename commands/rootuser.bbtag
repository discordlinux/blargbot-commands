description:**• Using root as your main or only user is a bad idea for any Linux distribution.**
**• Many programs are not designed to run as root or will cause permission errors if done so.**
**• If you're currently using a system only as root, *STOP!*.**
**• You should probably make a full backup and migrate to a non-root user. It'll save you trouble in the long run.**;
