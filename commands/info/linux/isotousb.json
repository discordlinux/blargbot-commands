If you have issues booting a USB created with Rufus, be sure to try both ISO and dd modes.\n\n## [Etcher](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases)\n- Easy to use with no install necessary.  Click 3 buttons and done.  Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.\n\n## [ROSA Image Writer](http://wiki.rosalab.ru/en/index.php/ROSA_ImageWriter#Where_can_I_take_it.3F)\n- Easy to use with no install.  Just extract it, make it executable, and run it.  Click 3 buttons and done.  Recommended for use on Linux and macOS only as it sometimes has issues writing from Windows.\n\n## [WoeUSB-ng](https://github.com/WoeUSB/WoeUSB-ng)\n- A Linux program to create a Windows USB stick installer from a real Windows DVD or image.\n\n## Unetbootin\n- Unetbootin is ***not recommended***.  Unetbootin modifies the bootloader of the ISO as it is written, replacing it with a CD bootloader which usually doesn't work correctly with modern ISOs.","tags":"Linux","title":"isotousb","modified":"20241115102900047","modifier":"Syretia","type":"text/markdown","caption":"Applications to Write ISOs to USBs","author_url":"https://discordlinux.github.io/wiki/#isotousb","author_icon":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/585665071938666508.png","embed_color":"#5865F2"}]
