[{"created":"20241115104858263","creator":"Syretia","text":"There are several different app bundlers available for Linux, such as Snaps, Flatpaks, and AppImages.\n\nEach of these creates an executable that includes its own libraries.\n\n## Snaps\n- Sandbox applications.\n- Update automatically without user interaction, which can unfortunately cause breakage with no clear indicators.\n\n## Flatpaks\n- Don't follow system themes, you must have a flatpak installed for the theme.\n- The flatpak package manager has also been known to have issues with dependencies.\n\n## AppImages\n- Not sandboxed, but are completely self-contained.\n- Each AppImage can update itself (but won't do so without telling the user).\n- This means that AppImages don't require a package manager or additional software, making them completely portable.\n\nBecause of these comparative features, if you need to use a bundled application we recommend using AppImages if possible.\n\n<br>\n\n*This entry is outdated and needs updating.  Perhaps remove this entry and create an entry for Flatpaks.*","tags":"Linux","title":"universal-packages","modified":"20241115105531193","modifier":"Syretia","type":"text/markdown","caption":"Universal Packages","author_url":"https://discordlinux.github.io/wiki/#universal-packages","author_icon":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/585665071938666508.png","embed_color":"#5865F2"}]
