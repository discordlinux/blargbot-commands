They can be used on almost any distribution, but require `snapd` to be installed to use them.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:SeemsGood:478441196755091461>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Advantages of Snaps\n- Can be used on almost any distribution.\n- Require no external dependencies to be installed other than `snapd` and the `core` snap provided by `snapd`.\n- Self contained; will not interfere with already installed packages.\n- Usually more up to date than packages in non rolling release distribution's repositories.\n- Large variety of packages available.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:glare:504911469943717909>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Disadvantages of Snaps\n- Listed in Ubuntu's GUI software center along with deb packages.\n- No testing is required.\n- Anyone can create and submit.\n- Any submission is listed for install through `snapd`.\n- Automatically update, updates cannot be turned off, and there is no notification of updates.\n- Creates 3 loop mounts for every installed snap.\n- Sandboxing setup can make many things more difficult to do.\n- Sandboxing gives users a false sense of security.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:think:585665071938666508>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Should You Use Snap Packages?\nIf you have no other choice, snaps are not the worst thing in the world to use, but make sure that you are aware of the disadvantages.  If you have problems with an application that you have installed as a snap package, there is a good chance those problems are because of the snap package and not related to the application itself.\n\nIf there is no native package available for your distribution, we suggest checking to see if there is an AppImage available before using a snap package (see <div emoji=\"`{prefix}info appimages`\" style=\"display:none;\"/>[AppImages](#appimages) for more info).\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:ubuntu:230469242183483392>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Using GUI Software Centers on Ubuntu/Ubuntu Flavors Without Snaps\nIf you would like to use the GUI software center applications that are available on Ubuntu and Ubuntu flavors without risking installing snap packages, run the following commands in a terminal:\n```\nsudo apt remove --autoremove --purge snapd\nsudo apt-mark hold snapd\n```","tags":"Linux","title":"snaps","modified":"20241115142913050","modifier":"Syretia","type":"text/markdown","caption":"Snap Packages","author_url":"https://discordlinux.github.io/wiki/#snaps","author_icon":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19532717","embed_color":"#E95420"}]
