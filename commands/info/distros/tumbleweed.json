Anything else will not move the system to the next rolling release and will most likely cause issues with orphaned packages.\r\n• Tumbleweed is updated when new packages in the Factory repos have passed [openqa testing](https://openqa.opensuse.org).  There are typically multiple updates released per week.\r\n• It is recommended that all Tumbleweed users follow the [Factory mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory) for information about new updates.\r\n**__Media Codecs__**\r\n• openSUSE cannot include certain media codecs due to license issues.  See the [Tumbleweed wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) for instructions on how to install them.\r\n**__openSUSE Build Service__**\r\n• The OBS can be used to find packages not in the default repos, find newer versions of packages, make changes to existing packages, or to create your own packages.\r\n• The [openSUSE software search](https://software.opensuse.org/search) site can be used to find and install packages from the OBS.\r\n• [zyp](https://software.opensuse.org/package/zyp) can also be used to find and install packages from the OBS.\r\n- `zyp` is a wrapper for `zypper` that adds searching for and installing packages from the OBS along with a few other features.\r\n- Repos for packages installed from the OBS with `zyp` are added with a lower priority than the default repos to avoid replacing system packages.\r\n\r\n**[Download openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed)**",
