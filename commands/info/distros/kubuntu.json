Because it uses Plasma, it is the most customizable Ubuntu flavor.  As is the case with all [official Ubuntu flavors](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours), Kubuntu has access to all of the packages in Ubuntu's repositories and can use PPAs created for Ubuntu.\n\n[Screenshots of Kubuntu](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Kubuntu_24.04)\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:SeemsGood:478441196755091461>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Advantages of Kubuntu\n- Fairly small install with around 1800 packages installed with the minimal install option.\n- Easy on CPU and RAM.\n- As of 24.04, uses Plasma version 5.27 which is very stable and has tons of features.\n- The 24.04 release is far better than previous releases of Kubuntu.\n- The most easily customizable Ubuntu flavor.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:glare:504911469943717909>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Disadvantages of Kubuntu\n- Previous releases were known to be relatively buggy and not a good Plasma experience.\n- Plasma software will be on a static version for the entire release cycle.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:think:585665071938666508>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Should You Use Kubuntu?\nIf you are looking for one of the most customizable Linux distributions out there, Kubuntu may be the distribution for you.  Kubuntu is also is light on resources and easy to use.
