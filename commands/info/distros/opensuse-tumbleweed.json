[{"created":"20241112151607890","creator":"Syretia","text":"## Updating openSUSE Tumbleweed\n- ***Always*** use `zypper dup` to update Tumbleweed.  Anything else will not move the system to the next rolling release and will most likely cause issues with orphaned packages.\n- Tumbleweed is updated when new packages in the Factory repos have passed [openqa testing](https://openqa.opensuse.org).  There are typically multiple updates released per week.\n- It is recommended that all Tumbleweed users follow the [Factory mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory) for information about new updates.\n\n## Media Codecs\n- openSUSE cannot include certain media codecs due to license issues.  See the [Tumbleweed wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) for instructions on how to install them.\n\n## openSUSE Build Service\n- The OBS can be used to find packages not in the default repos, find newer versions of packages, make changes to existing packages, or to create your own packages.\n- The [openSUSE software search](https://software.opensuse.org/search) site can be used to find and install packages from the OBS.\n- [zow](https://software.opensuse.org/package/zow) can also be used to find and install packages from the OBS.\n- `zow` is a wrapper for `zypper` that adds searching for and installing packages from the OBS along with a few other features.\n- Repos for packages installed from the OBS with `zow` are added with a lower priority than the default repos to avoid replacing system packages.\n\n[Please read the Tumbleweed wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed)\n\n[Download openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed)\n\nSee <div emoji=\"`{prefix}info opensuse`\" style=\"display:none;\"/>[openSUSE Leap](#opensuse-leap) for more information about openSUSE.\n\nSee <div emoji=\"`{prefix}info rolling`\" style=\"display:none;\"/>[Rolling Releases](#rolling-releases) for more information about rolling releases.","tags":"Distributions","title":"opensuse-tumbleweed","modified":"20241115142016685","modifier":"Syretia","type":"text/markdown","caption":"openSUSE Tumbleweed","author_url":"https://discordlinux.github.io/wiki/#opensuse-tumbleweed","author_icon":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/230547025152835584.png","embed_color":"#73BA25"}]
