One is chosen during install and can be changed later.\n- Package installation and updates can take a long time for big applications. These applications may also have a binary option, but you lose the configurability of USE flags by opting to use binary packages.\n- Not beginner friendly. The community is willing to help those who show that they have put effort into solving a problem, but those who cannot/do not have the knowledge to help themselves should stay away.\n    \n[Download Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/)","tags":"Distributions","title":"gentoo","modified":"20241111173617171","modifier":"Syretia","type":"text/markdown","caption":"Gentoo","author_url":"https://discordlinux.github.io/wiki/#gentoo","author_icon":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/230467839570608129.png","embed_color":"#7A5ADA"}]
