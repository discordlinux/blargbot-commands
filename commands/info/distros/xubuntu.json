[{"created":"20241112153433830","creator":"Syretia","text":"Xubuntu is an [official Ubuntu flavor](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours) that uses the [Xfce Desktop Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce).  It is often considered to be the most stable Ubuntu flavor.  As is the case with all [official Ubuntu flavors](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours), Xubuntu has access to all of the packages in Ubuntu's repositories and can use PPAs created for Ubuntu.\n\n[Screenshots of Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/screenshots/)\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:SeemsGood:478441196755091461>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Advantages of Xubuntu\n- Fairly small install with around 1900 packages installed by default.\n- Easy on CPU and RAM.\n- Xfce always tests their software extensively before making releases, so it is usually very stable.\n- Very easy to customize the way things look and act through Xfce's settings manager.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:glare:504911469943717909>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Disadvantages of Xubuntu\n- Default setup is very bland looking, but is easy to change.\n- Can feel a bit outdated compared to other Desktop Environments.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:think:585665071938666508>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Should You Use Xubuntu?\nIf you are looking for a Linux distribution that is light on resources, very easy to use, extremely stable, and highly customizable, it doesn't get much better than Xubuntu.  The only problems some people may have with Xubuntu are the default looks and the slow release cycle of Xfce, but the looks are easily changed, and the release cycle of Xfce is the main reason that Xubuntu is more stable than other Ubuntu flavors.\n\n[Download Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/download/)\n\nIf you'd like something a bit more modern feeling than Xubuntu, we recommend checking out Ubuntu MATE (see <div emoji=\"`{prefix}info ubuntu mate`\" style=\"display:none;\"/>[Ubuntu MATE](#ubuntu-mate)) or Kubuntu (see <div emoji=\"`{prefix}info kubuntu`\" style=\"display:none;\"/>[Kubuntu](#kubuntu)).\n\nSee <div emoji=\"`{prefix}info ubuntu`\" style=\"display:none;\"/>[Ubuntu](#ubuntu) for more information about Ubuntu.","tags":"Distributions","title":"xubuntu","modified":"20241115142451098","modifier":"Syretia","type":"text/markdown","caption":"Xubuntu","author_url":"https://discordlinux.github.io/wiki/#xubuntu","author_icon":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Xubuntu_logo.svg/1024px-Xubuntu_logo.svg.png","embed_color":"#0044AA"}]
