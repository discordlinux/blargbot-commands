The MATE Desktop Environment was originally forked from GNOME 2, so Ubuntu MATE feels similar to GNOME, but is much more customizable and easier on resources.  As is the case with all [official Ubuntu flavors](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours), Ubuntu MATE has access to all of the packages in Ubuntu's repositories and can use PPAs created for Ubuntu.\n\n[Screenshots of Ubuntu MATE](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ubuntu_MATE_24.04)\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:SeemsGood:478441196755091461>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Advantages of Ubuntu MATE\n- Fairly small install with around 1900 packages installed by default.\n- Easy on CPU and RAM.\n- Very easy to customize the way things look and act through MATE Control Center.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:glare:504911469943717909>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Disadvantages of Ubuntu MATE\n- Default setup might be unattractive to some users, but is easy to change.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:think:585665071938666508>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Should You Use Ubuntu MATE?\nIf you like Xubuntu, but want something a bit more modern feeling, Ubuntu MATE may be the distribution for you.
