This could result in packages from Ubuntu's repos replacing packages that were installed from Mint's repos during upgrades which will most likely break things.\n- Has been known to mix Ubuntu and Debian packages, resulting in a [FrankenDebian](https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian#Don.27t_make_a_FrankenDebian).\n- Has been known to have issues with upgrading between releases.\n- Website has been hacked twice; one of these times resulted in malware being distributed in Linux Mint's ISOs.\n\nInstead of using Linux Mint, we highly recommend using Ubuntu MATE (see <div emoji=\"`{prefix}info ubuntu mate`\" style=\"display:none;\"/>[Ubuntu MATE](#ubuntu-mate)).\n\nSee <div emoji=\"`{prefix}info recommended`\" style=\"display:none;\"/>[Recommended](#recommended) for a list of recommended distros.","tags":"Distributions","title":"mint","modified":"20241115141737220","modifier":"Syretia","type":"text/markdown","caption":"Linux Mint","author_url":"https://discordlinux.github.io/wiki/#mint","author_icon":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Linux_Mint_logo_without_wordmark.svg/2000px-Linux_Mint_logo_without_wordmark.svg.png","embed_color":"#87D23B"}]
