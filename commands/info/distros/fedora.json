[{"created":"20241111092429788","creator":"Syretia","text":"- Basically a much more up-to-date CentOS or RHEL.\n- RPM-based using dnf as it's package manager.\n- Relatively easy syntax\n- Slower at installing packages than most other package managers\n- GNOME Desktop Environment is the main \"spin\" and is the only recommended way to use Fedora.\n- Other than the Xfce spin, most Fedora spins are lackluster.\n- Ships with only open source and unencumbered software in the official repos, you'll need to enable third party repos for anything closed source or with restrictive licensing.\n- 6-month release cycle with a 12-month support window.\n- Desktop Environment and core applications typically only get updated with a new release.\n- Kernel and mesa versions do get pushed frequently.\n- Not recommended for people new to Linux due to the release cycle and default partition setup.\n\n## SELinux\n\n- This is a common barrier for new Fedora users.  SELinux is a security measure that many think over-steps it's boundaries.\n- The easiest solution if SELinux is blocking an application you need is to put it into permissive mode: `sudo setenforce 0`\n\n## Fedy\n\n- [Fedy](https://github.com/rpmfusion-infra/fedy#introduction) essentially puts a list of some of the more common proprietary applications or harder to enable tweaks into a nice consise menu of one-click setups.\n\n## Third-Party Repos\n\n- [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration)\n- Where you'll likely find most of the applications and tools you need that aren't in the official repos.\n- [Negativo17](https://negativo17.org/repositories/)\n-  If you'd rather enable one repo per application instead of one huge one, this is the route you should go.\n- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/home)\n- Not technically a third party repo but Fedora does have Flatpak enabled by default, so if all of the proprietary applications are available, it's worth trying out.\n- Flatpaks are sandboxes and typically come with tight file permissions, so some functions may not work or may require you to manually override file perms.\n\n[Download Fedora](https://getfedora.org)\n\n<br>\n\n*This entry is outdated and needs updating.*","tags":"Distributions","title":"fedora","modified":"20241115101731358","modifier":"Syretia","type":"text/markdown","caption":"Fedora","author_url":"https://discordlinux.github.io/wiki/#fedora","author_icon":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/230467829734834178.png","embed_color":"#3d65b9"}]
