KDE neon was created by the former project lead of Kubuntu, Jonathan Riddell.  Even though KDE neon is not an [official Ubuntu flavor](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours), it still has access to all of the packages in Ubuntu's repositories and can use PPAs created for Ubuntu.\n\n[Screenshots of KDE neon](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:KDE_neon_releases)\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:SeemsGood:478441196755091461>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Advantages of KDE neon\n- Maintained by the KDE developers themselves.\n- Small install size; around 1600 packages.\n- Offers the latest KDE packages on a stable base.\n- Plasma is the most customizable Desktop Environment for Linux.\n- Usually gets Plasma updates before any other distro.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:glare:504911469943717909>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Disadvantages of KDE neon\n- **Very** frequent package updates, so may not be great for people who are not computer savvy.\n- May run into bugs due to frequent Plasma package updates.\n\n## <div emoji=\"<:think:585665071938666508>\" style=\"display:none;\"/> Should You Use KDE neon?\nIf you are looking for the latest KDE Plasma packages on a stable base, KDE neon is the distribution for you.  KDE neon is extremely customizable, stable, and fairly easy to use.  Please only use the `User Edition` of KDE neon as the other two versions are not intended for normal use.\n\n[Download KDE neon](https://files.kde.org/neon/images/user/current/neon-user-current.iso.mirrorlist)\n\n## Updating KDE neon\n- Instead of using `apt upgrade`, it is recommended to use `apt full-upgrade` to avoid problems with updates.\n- Contrary to what KDE neon recommends on their website, `pkcon` is ***not recommended***.  `pkcon` is buggy when used in a terminal.\n\n## Ubuntu Driver Manager\n- After installing KDE neon, you can install Ubuntu's driver manager by running the following command in a terminal: `sudo apt install software-properties-gtk`\n- Then find Software & Updates in your menu and switch to the Additional Drivers tab.\n\nSee <div emoji=\"`{prefix}info ubuntu`\" style=\"display:none;\"/>[Ubuntu](#ubuntu) for more information about Ubuntu.","tags":"Distributions","title":"kde-neon","modified":"20241115141500543","modifier":"Syretia","type":"text/markdown","caption":"KDE neon","author_url":"https://discordlinux.github.io/wiki/#kde-neon","author_icon":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/593596525024903239.png","embed_color":"#3DC08D"}]
